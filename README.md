## Energy Harvesting in RIS-Assisted Relay Networks
[ Publication ](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2744623082?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true&sourcetype=Dissertations%20&%20Theses)

As a part of my Master's thesis the performance of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is explored for a Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted relay system.
Because radio-frequency (RF) signals can convey both information and energy simultaneously, there has been much research interest in designing novel technologies for simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT) and energy harvesting (EH).
First, an RIS-assisted relay system model is proposed to improve the wireless system performance. By characterizing the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) attained through intelligent phase-shift controlling, the performance of the RIS-assisted relay system is investigated. Towards this end, tight bounds for the average achievable rate and optimal harvested energy are derived in closed-form for a hybrid SWIPT protocolThen, the performance of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is explored for the proposed RIS-assisted relay system. Also, the performance of linear EH models and non-linear EH models are compared via analytical and Monte-Carlo simulation results.

## On the Performance of IRS-Assisted Relay Systems
[ Publication ](https://doi.org/10.1109/GLOBECOM46510.2021.9685500)

This project investigates the performance of intelligence reflective surface (IRS)-assisted relay systems. To this end, we quantify the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) attained by smartly controlling the phase-shifts of impinging electromagnetic waves upon an IRS. Thereby, a tightly approximated cumulative distribution function is derived to probabilistically characterize this optimal SNR. Then, we derive tight approximations/bounds for the achievable rate, outage probability, and average symbol error rate. Monte-Carlo simulations are used to validate our performance analysis. We present numerical results to reveal that the IRS-assisted relay system can boost the performance of end-to-end wireless transmissions.
